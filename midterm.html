      <h2>Main Room</h2>
      The Main Room, located along the north driveway adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center, is a treasure trove housing a diverse collection of books, including hardbound editions starting at a mere $1 and paperbacks available for just 50 cents each. This room serves as a hub for book donations, welcoming large contributions. Catering to book enthusiasts of all kinds, it's an ideal spot to peruse through an array of literary works while indulging in affordable deals. With a policy allowing the selection of only 12 books at a time during the initial hour on Saturdays, visitors can hold their chosen items at the cashiers' station until they're ready to make their final purchases.
